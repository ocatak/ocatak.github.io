<p>5G and beyond security research is an important area of interest for academics and researchers. This research aims to ensure that 5G networks and beyond are secure and safe from cyber-attacks. This research is important because 5G networks will be used for various critical applications, such as healthcare, transportation, and energy. 5G and beyond security research will help to ensure that these applications are secure and that users can trust the networks.</p>

<p>So far, we have developed security methods for AI-based</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beamforming</strong></li>
  <li><strong>MIMO systems</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Spectrum sensing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Channel estimation</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent-reflective surfaces,</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>and more which will be extremely useful for the future 5G and 6G networks. We also proposed the first comprehensive security framework for 5G and beyond, which will be very helpful for mobile network operators and other stakeholders to deploy secure 5G networks. My future work includes developing security methods for new 5G and beyond technologies, such as mmWave, massive MIMO, and full-duplex. We also plan to continue our work on the comprehensive security framework to make it even more comprehensive and user-friendly.</p>

<strong>3. Security Hardening of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks</strong> (IEEE Access 2022)</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5g/irs.png" alt="drawing" width="500"></p>

<p>This paper focuses on the security threats and mitigation for Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered applications in Next-Generation (NextG) networks. The paper specifically looks at the implementation of AI-powered Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) in NextG networks and the vulnerability of these systems to adversarial machine learning attacks. The paper proposes the defensive distillation mitigation method as a way to reduce the vulnerability of AI-powered IRS models. The study’s results indicate that the defensive distillation mitigation method can significantly improve the robustness of AI-powered models and their performance under an adversarial attack.</p>

<strong>5. Security concerns on machine learning solutions for 6G networks in mmWave beam prediction</strong> (Physical Communication)</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5g/physical_communication.png" alt="drawing" width="500"></p>

<p>The paper studies the application of machine learning algorithms to 6G technology and the security concerns that arise from their use. It proposes a mitigation method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G ML models for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial training. The main idea behind generating adversarial attacks against ML models is to produce faulty results by manipulating trained DL models for 6G applications for mmWave beam prediction. The paper presents the performance of the proposed adversarial learning mitigation method for 6G security in mmWave beam prediction application, a fast gradient sign method attack. The results show that the defended model under attack’s mean square errors (i.e., the prediction accuracy) is very close to the undefended model without attack.</p>

The Adversarial Security Mitigations of mmWave Beamforming Prediction Models using Defensive Distillation and Adversarial Retraining (Under Review, 2022)</strong></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5g/beamforming-2.png" alt="drawing" width="700"></p>

<p>This paper presents the security vulnerabilities in deep learning for beamforming prediction using deep neural networks (DNNs) in 6G wireless networks, which treats the beamforming prediction as a multi-output regression problem. It is indicated that the initial DNN model is vulnerable against adversarial attacks, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), because the initial DNN model is sensitive to the perturbations of the adversarial samples of the training data. This study also offers two mitigation methods, such as adversarial training and defensive distillation, for adversarial attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-based models used in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beamforming prediction. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be used when the data are corrupted due to the adversarial examples in the training data. Experimental results show that the proposed methods effectively defend the DNN models against adversarial attacks in next-generation wireless networks.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/5g/beamforming-1.png" alt="drawing" width="700"></p>

<p>This paper proposes a mitigation method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning models for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial learning. 6G is the next generation of communication systems and will use predictive algorithms. The main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to produce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning models for 6G applications for mmWave beam prediction. The mean square errors of the defended model under attack are very close to the undefended model without attack. With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, it is critical to consider security concerns when applying the algorithms.</p>
